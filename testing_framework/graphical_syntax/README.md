A set of plugins from [TDL open-source project](https://labs.etsi.org/rep/top/ide) which define the graphical concrete syntax of the TDL. 
We extended the standard to provide model animation.
Indeed, according to the TDL standard, a TDL test case is modeled similarly to a sequence diagram in which data exchanges between the test system and the system under test are modeled as arrows carrying data. 
In our extension, we enable highlighting the arrows based on their execution status: Green for success, Red for failure.
